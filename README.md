# Excel Interactive Dashboards

I created two interactive Excel dashboards from scratch by using Pivot tables, Pivot charts and Slicers to apply filters. Data is about a hypothetical company’s sales and customer success performance. 

Datasets can be downloaded via the links below:

## Sales Performance Dashboard

This sales performance dashboard gives you a detailed overview of the organization’s Key Performance Indicators at a glance. It provides a line graph showing the progress of sales by month for years 2020 -2021. It also shows charts on Sales by Region, Sales by Employee, Item Share and Customer Revenue per customer.

## Customer Success Dashboard

A Customer Success dashboard keeps track of a company’s health in connection to its product and users. The dashboard below focuses on Customer Satisfaction scores, Customer Acquisition and Target rates for both on-time and late deliveries.

Similar to the Sales Performance dashboard above, the use of slicers allows you to filter the dataset in order to better analyze the data. You can select to filter by specific Year, Product, Customer Acquisition type and State.
